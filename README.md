# PASTA
PASTA: an efficient proactive adaptation approach based on statistical model checking for self-adaptive systems

# PASTA skelenton
We provide skeleton code for implementation of PASTA approach to SAS developers in Java and Python.
This skeleton code provides domain- and application- general PASTA code including its structure and adaptation process.
SAS developers can save their time with this pre-implemented PASTA skeleton code.

# How to use PASTA skeleton
1. Download the source code.
2. Follow the "todo" signs and implement domain-specific codes. Domain-general PASTA implementation codes (structure and adaptation process) are already given to you.
3. Run your PASTA-based managing system to adapt your system. Refer the example "main" file.

# Reference
You can find detail information about PASTA in our original paper. (Link: under review now)
